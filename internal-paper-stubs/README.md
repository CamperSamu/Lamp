# Paper stubs

## What is this?
This simply contains definitions for classes and methods in the Paper API. _Only definitions_. We don't include any implementations here, and any non-abstract functions throw exceptions.

This is simply to provide resolvable classes at compile-time, without having to depend on Paper's dependency directly, because it requires Java 21.

This is internal and is not intended for public use. It may change without notice.
