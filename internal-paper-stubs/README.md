# Paper stubs

## What is this?

This simply contains definitions for classes and methods in the Paper API. _Only definitions_. We don't include any
implementations here, and any non-abstract functions throw exceptions.

This is simply to provide resolvable classes at compile-time, without having to depend on Paper's dependency directly,
because it requires Java 21.

Even then, these stubs are not 100% equal to Paper's. They have been modified a little to avoid compiler errors and
Javadoc problems.

This is internal and is not intended for public use. It may change or get removed without notice.
